    <h1>This website is under development by <a href="https://andrewjmitchell.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Mitchell</a></h1>
    <h2>It's also <a href="">open source</a> on GitHub.</h2>
    <p>The plan for this website is to take the massively complex field of and topics related to nuclear power and turn them into an organized website
    that is easily readable by average people.</p>
    <p>You may ask why? Well, writing about topics I find interesting is something I enjoy doing, as I already 
      do on my <a href="https://ditd.substack.com/" target="_blank">newsletter</a> and <a href="https://anchor.fm/geeking-out-with-andy" target="_blank">podcast</a>.</p>
    <p>I will try to be as unbiased as possible and will provide sources for much of the info provided. However, I will mention upfront that after
      all the research I've done so far, I believe nuclear power is a safe and efficient source of power and humanity should rapidly build nuclear
      energy capabilities alongside other renewables.
